- [ ] I can create tasks that can be marked complete. 
- [ ] I can designate task prerequisites, including other tasks, available calendar time, items, etc. 
- [ ] Tasks won't appear until their prerequisites are met. / I can chain tasks so that completing one task brings up the next one in the chain.

- [ ] I want to forward an email and have it turn into a task.

User research:
- "Takes longer to make a task than to actually do the task. Only useful for recurring tasks."
- "If I don't make a task right when I learn about some deadline, I'd end up creating the task and completing it at the deadline instead of working on the deadline itself."
- "Need motivation to do some tasks."
- "Don't want emails telling me what to do."
- "I don't get through all my tasks, so they build up and prevent me from working on important things."
